            <h3>Resident Evil 2 (2019)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> An excellent remake with tight controls, atmospheric horror, and a great story. Highly recommended for fans of survival horror.</p>

            <h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> One of the best superhero films of all time. Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker is legendary.</p>

            <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> A monumental achievement in open-world design. The attention to detail is staggering, and the story is a slow-burn masterpiece. Arthur Morgan's journey is complex and emotional, making this one of the best games of the last decade.</p>

            <h3>Resident Evil 3 (2020 Remake)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Resident Evil 3 delivers a fast-paced, action-packed experience. The visuals are impressive, and Jill Valentine is a strong, capable protagonist. However, the game feels a bit short compared to Resident Evil 2, and some areas seem rushed. Despite its brief length, the relentless pursuit by Nemesis keeps the tension high, offering memorable moments of panic and survival. A solid entry in the series, but not quite as impactful as the Resident Evil 2 remake.</p>

            <h3>Alien: Isolation (2014)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Alien: Isolation is a masterclass in tension and atmospheric horror. The game captures the essence of the original Alien film, making you feel helpless as you are hunted by a near-invincible xenomorph. The AI is incredibly smart, and every encounter is a terrifying game of cat-and-mouse. The sound design and visuals perfectly complement the horror, creating an immersive experience. Though the pacing may feel slow at times, it only adds to the dread, making each moment of calm before the storm even more nerve-wracking. A must-play for survival horror fans.</p>

            <h3>NCAA Football 25</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> NCAA Football 25 is a nostalgic return to college football, with updated graphics and refined mechanics. The gameplay feels smooth, and the attention to detail in stadiums and team rosters brings authenticity to each game. Dynasty mode remains a highlight, allowing you to build a program from the ground up. However, some features feel recycled from previous entries, and while it’s a solid football game, it doesn’t quite push boundaries like its NFL counterparts. Still, for fans of college football, it's a welcome and long-awaited return.</p>

            <h3>Goodfellas (1990)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Goodfellas is an iconic mob movie that masterfully blends style and substance. Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless, with dynamic camera work and a killer soundtrack that perfectly capture the rise and fall of Henry Hill. The performances, especially from Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, are unforgettable. The film’s pacing is relentless, pulling you into the seductive and dangerous world of organized crime. It’s a gripping, gritty tale that remains a landmark in the gangster genre.</p>

            <h3>Casino (1995)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Casino is a fascinating and stylish look into the world of Las Vegas casinos and organized crime. Once again, Martin Scorsese delivers a masterful narrative, with De Niro and Pesci delivering standout performances. Sharon Stone steals the show as Ginger, bringing an emotional depth to the story. While it shares thematic elements with Goodfellas, Casino feels more expansive and methodical in its pacing. The attention to detail in the lavish Vegas setting is impeccable. Though not as tight as Goodfellas, it’s still a captivating and brutal story of power and downfall.</p>

            <h3>Civil War (A24 Film)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Civil War is a gripping and thought-provoking film that showcases A24's trademark blend of atmospheric storytelling and complex characters. The narrative explores the psychological and societal impacts of conflict, with a focus on the human cost of war. The performances are powerful, with the lead delivering a haunting portrayal of a journalist grappling with moral ambiguity. The cinematography is stunning, using stark visuals to enhance the film's tense and unsettling mood. While the pacing may be slow for some, it allows the story to unfold with a measured intensity that lingers long after the credits roll. A compelling watch for those who appreciate nuanced and introspective cinema.</p>
